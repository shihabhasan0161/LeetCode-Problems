## Problem Understanding 🤔

Given a string s and an integer k, we need to determine if we can construct exactly k palindrome strings using all characters from s. Each character must be used exactly once.

## Key Insights 💡

- Characters with even frequency can always be split into palindromes
- Characters with odd frequency must be at the center of palindromes
- The number of characters with odd frequency determines the minimum number of palindromes possible

## Solution Approach 🎯

The approach can be broken down into these simple steps:

1. First, check if length of string is less than k 
    - If true, return false (can't make more palindromes than available characters)
2. If length equals k 
    - Return true (we can split into single character palindromes)
3. Count frequency of each character 
    - Use an array of size 26 for lowercase letters
    - Increment count for each character occurrence
4. Count characters with odd frequencies 
    - Use % 2 to check if frequency is odd
    - Keep running sum of odd frequency counts
5. Final check: 
    - oddCount ≤ k ≤ s.length()

## Why This Works? 🧐

The logic behind this solution:

- We need at least as many palindromes as odd-frequency characters (each must be center of a palindrome)
- We can't create more palindromes than the string length
- Even-frequency characters can be freely distributed to form palindromes

## Time & Space Complexity ⚡

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of string s

Space Complexity: O(1) as we use fixed size array of 26 characters

## Code Implementation 💻

class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String s, int k) {
        if(s.length() < k) {
            return false;
        }
        if(s.length() == k) {
            return true;
        }
        
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int oddCount = 0;
        for(int frequency : freq) {
            oddCount += frequency % 2;
        }
        
        return oddCount <= k && k <= s.length();
    }
}

## Pro Tips 🌟

- Always handle edge cases first (length < k and length == k)
- Use frequency array for character counting - it's faster than HashMap for known character set
- Remember that even-frequency characters are flexible in palindrome formation
